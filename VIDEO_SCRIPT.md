## üìù Script Outline

### INTRODUCTION (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Screen: Show Project Title Screen]**

**Narrator:**
> "Hello! Today I'm excited to present the Companies Directory - a modern, responsive React application that showcases advanced frontend development techniques, stunning animations, and exceptional user experience design."

**[Screen: Show live application landing page]**

> "This project demonstrates everything from real-time search and advanced filtering to dark mode theming and performance optimization."

---

### FEATURE SHOWCASE (0:30 - 4:00)

#### 1. ANIMATED BACKGROUND (0:30 - 0:50)

**[Screen: Zoom in on background, slow motion]**

**Narrator:**
> "Let's start with the visual foundation. The application features a dynamic animated background built with Framer Motion."

**[Action: Highlight particles]**

> "You can see 50 floating particles moving organically, along with large gradient orbs that create depth and ambiance. The background adapts to the current theme - watch what happens..."

**[Action: Toggle theme]**

> "Notice how smoothly the colors transition, creating a cohesive experience."

---

#### 2. REAL-TIME SEARCH (0:50 - 1:20)

**[Screen: Focus on search bar]**

**Narrator:**
> "The search functionality is instant and intelligent."

**[Action: Type "Artificial Intelligence" slowly]**

> "As I type, the application searches across company names, industries, and descriptions simultaneously. No need to press enter - results appear in real-time."

**[Action: Clear search]**

> "The search integrates seamlessly with our filtering system, which brings me to..."

---

#### 3. ADVANCED FILTERING (1:20 - 2:00)

**[Screen: Show filter dropdowns]**

**Narrator:**
> "The filtering system supports multiple dimensions. Let's filter by location..."

**[Action: Select "San Francisco, CA"]**

> "...by industry..."

**[Action: Select "Technology"]**

> "...and by company size..."

**[Action: Select "Startup"]**

> "All filters work together using AND logic, providing precise results. When filters are active, a convenient 'Clear Filters' button appears."

**[Action: Click Clear Filters]**

---

#### 4. SORTING & ORGANIZATION (2:00 - 2:30)

**[Screen: Focus on sort dropdown]**

**Narrator:**
> "Companies can be sorted by six different criteria. Let's sort by employee count..."

**[Action: Select "Most Employees"]**

> "The grid instantly reorganizes. We can also sort alphabetically, by founding year, in ascending or descending order."

**[Action: Cycle through 2-3 sort options quickly]**

---

#### 5. COMPANY CARDS & INTERACTIONS (2:30 - 3:00)

**[Screen: Focus on company cards, hover slowly]**

**Narrator:**
> "Each company is displayed in a beautiful card with glassmorphism effects - that's the frosted glass appearance with backdrop blur."

**[Action: Hover over multiple cards]**

> "On hover, cards scale up and display a subtle glow effect. The cards contain comprehensive information: company logo, industry, location, employee count, founding year, and a direct link to their website."

**[Action: Click a website link to show it opens in new tab]**

---

#### 6. PAGINATION SYSTEM (3:00 - 3:25)

**[Screen: Scroll to pagination]**

**Narrator:**
> "For performance, results are paginated with 9 companies per page. The pagination component is smart - it uses ellipsis for large page counts and always shows the current position."

**[Action: Navigate through pages 1, 2, 3, then jump to last page]**

> "Notice how the page smoothly scrolls to the top after each navigation. The counter at the bottom shows exactly which companies you're viewing."

---

#### 7. DARK MODE & THEME SYSTEM (3:25 - 3:50)

**[Screen: Focus on theme toggle button]**

**Narrator:**
> "One of my favorite features is the dark mode implementation."

**[Action: Toggle to dark mode]**

> "Watch how every element transitions smoothly - not just colors, but the entire visual hierarchy adapts. The background animations change their palette, cards adjust their transparency, and text maintains perfect contrast."

**[Action: Toggle back to light mode]**

> "The theme choice is persisted in localStorage, so it remembers your preference between sessions."

---

#### 8. RESPONSIVE DESIGN (3:50 - 4:15)

**[Screen: Slowly resize browser from desktop to mobile]**

**Narrator:**
> "The application is fully responsive. At desktop size, we see a three-column grid..."

**[Action: Resize to tablet width]**

> "...at tablet width, it becomes two columns..."

**[Action: Resize to mobile]**

> "...and on mobile, a single column with a collapsible filter menu. Every element is touch-optimized and accessible."

**[Action: Show mobile filter collapse/expand]**

---

### TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE (4:15 - 5:30)

**[Screen: Show code editor or architecture diagram]**

**Narrator:**
> "Let's briefly discuss the technical implementation."

#### Architecture (4:15 - 4:45)

**[Screen: Show folder structure]**

> "The project follows a clean component-based architecture. Components are organized by responsibility: presentational components for UI, container components for logic, and context for global state."

**[Screen: Show ThemeContext code]**

> "Dark mode is managed through React Context API with localStorage persistence. This eliminates prop drilling and keeps the theme logic centralized."

#### Performance (4:45 - 5:10)

**[Screen: Show useMemo and useCallback examples]**

> "Performance is optimized through React's useMemo and useCallback hooks. Pagination calculations are memoized, preventing unnecessary re-computations. Event handlers are wrapped in useCallback to maintain stable references."

**[Screen: Show animation code]**

> "Animations use GPU-accelerated properties - transform and opacity - ensuring smooth 60fps performance even on mobile devices."

#### Accessibility (5:10 - 5:30)

**[Screen: Show ARIA labels in code]**

> "The application is fully accessible with ARIA labels on all interactive elements, keyboard navigation support, and semantic HTML. Every button, input, and link has proper labeling for screen readers."

---

### CONCLUSION (5:30 - 6:00)

**[Screen: Return to application homepage]**

**Narrator:**
> "To summarize, this Companies Directory demonstrates:"

**[Screen: Show bullet points]**
- Modern React patterns and hooks
- Advanced animation with Framer Motion  
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Performance optimization techniques
- Accessibility best practices
- Clean code architecture

> "The application is production-ready, fully documented, and easy to extend with additional features."

---

### CLOSING (6:00 - 6:30)

**[Screen: Show README or GitHub repo]**

**Narrator:**
> "All code is thoroughly documented with README, project overview, and quick start guides. The project includes 25 diverse companies, mock API with network delays, and comprehensive error handling."

**[Screen: Show final application view]**

> "Thank you for watching! The code is available for review, and I'm happy to answer any questions about the implementation, design decisions, or future enhancements."

**[Screen: Fade to end screen with contact info]**
